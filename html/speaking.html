      <h2>Conor Dowdall | Motivational Speaker</h2>

        <p>
          Conor Dowdall is the author of two best-selling self-help books,
          <i>Believe in Me Believing in You</i> and
          <i>Public Speaking: Don't Be Such a Nervous Nelly</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2003, Conor founded the not-for-profit organisation
          <i>Ego, Alms, & Charity</i>, which he does not use as a way to avoid
          paying tax. The organisation helps underprivileged children as young
          as 5-years-old to believe in themselves a bit more and was described
          by The Irish Times as
          <i
            >"...employ[ing] unusual practices, beyond the understanding of even
            the most advanced 5-year-old"</i
          >. Conor's work in this area earned him a spot on the prestigious
          <i>Forbes 30 Under 30</i> list alongside activists like Greta
          Thunberg.

        <p>
          Conor Dowdall is the founder and head of the Śūnyatā Foundation. The
          foundation, established in 2006, operates an ashram and yoga centre
          that carries out educational and spiritual activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dowdall worked in the construction industry for many years, performing
          back-breaking labour and injuring himself many times, mostly from
          walking into walls or other bits of furniture and things. After being
          bitten by a pig, he had a series of spiritual experiences, which
          resulted in him leaving construction behind and beginning to teach
          yoga. He eventually developed his own style of yoga which he calls
          <i>Half Yoga</i> that focuses on building physical strength in
          typically under-developed parts of the body like the fingers and toes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conor has authored over thirty books on the topic, including the New
          York Times bestsellers
          <i>Inner Peace: A Yogi's Guide to Inner Peace</i> and
          <i>Fingers and Toes: A Yogi's Guide to Fingers and Toes</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instant enlightenment guaranteed, Conor can be booked for a public
          speaking engagement on the topic of spirituality and yoga for
          €400,000. Make a booking using the
